This project aims to demonstrate how search algorithms function in maze-like environments, helping users visualize and understand the process of finding optimal paths from one point to another. It provides an interactive way to explore different search strategies and their effectiveness in various scenarios. The user selects a search algorithm , starting and ending points and walls . The application finds the shortest path considering the walls and input taken by the user. After finding the shortest path the path is being highlighted. And the steps are being  shown.
